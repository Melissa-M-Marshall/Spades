# Spades
Contains various versions of the game spades, as a learning function for different programming languages and new types of structures.

At present, the only version is in Python, and is a computer only version of the game spades, used to experiment with larger program types, object-oriented programming, and arrays.

As of 3/3/22, there is a new section called javaImplementation, which will be java code, and will have a full UML diagram breakdown. It will also have a GUI added in.
